Labware definition(containers):
	# Define parameters for different kind of labware. Can also be used for modules
	
	type of labware:
		multiwell plate: 	flat plate with multiple "wells" used as small test tubes. Goes from 6 to 1536 wells.
		tube: 				Individual tubes, usually 0.2, 0.5, 1.5, 2, 5, 15, 50 ml.
		tube rack:			Rack containing tubes. Different racks are needed depending on the tube size.
		pipette tip: 		Disposable tips going at the end of the pipette. Depending on the size of the pipette, user needs specific tip size.
		tip box:			Box containing the pipette tips.
		plate rack:			Rack to receive a multiwell plate (ex: thermo rack, magnetic rack, other modules)
		other container:	Any other container (rectangle container for liquid, petri dish, etc.)
		
	parameters for each labware:
		multiwell plate:
			name
			company (optional)
			catalogue number (optional)
			plate height
			plate width
			plate length
			first well position (x y)
			distance between wells x
			distance between wells y
			well count
			column count
			well depth
			well width					# instead of diameter because some wells are square shaped
			well shape					# round square
			well bottom shape     		# flat bottom round bottom v shaped deepwell pcr tube
			well max volume(optional)
			dead volume(optional)
			
		tube:
			name
			company

			first tube position (x y)
			distance between tubes x
			distance between tubes y
			tubes count
			column count
			tube z offset	
			
		pipette tip:
			volume min
			volume max
			length
			length on pipette
		
		tip box:

			box height
			box width
			box length
			first tip position (x y)
			distance between tips x
			distance between tips y
			tips count
			column count

		plate rack:
			z offset
		
		Other container:
			name
			company
			catalogue number
			height
			width
			length
			shape 						# rectangle round
			depth
		
		
Deck layout:
	# Define every labware and modules on the robot deck.
	# An instance of a labware with a specific name that can be referenced in an instruction.
	# Labware could be stack (example, rack + tube, multiple tip box stacked).
	
	Name of labware
	position of labware and modules on the deck (x, y)
	labware is lid or not
	track tips

	
Tool rack layout:
	# Define the position and type of each tool on the tool rack.
	# The position correspond to the center of the tool relative to the centre of the tool rack.
	
	tool name
	tool company
	tool type					# Gripper, single channel pipette, multichannel pipette
	tool position
	

Instructions:
	# Command line to accomplish one action
	
	with tool "T" do action "X"
	example:
		with pipette1 move_to (x, y) or (multiwell_plate_1;A1)
		with pipette1 move_to (z)
		with pipette1 aspirate (n ul, s ul/sec)

	
Tool actions (low level instruction):
	# basic actions a specific tool or module can do.
	# correspond to low level instructions
	
	Single channel pipette:
		move (x, y, z, speed)
		aspirate (volume, speed)
		dispense (volume, speed)
		load tip
		eject tip

	Single channel pipette:
		move (x, y, z, speed)
		aspirate (volume, speed)
		dispense (volume, speed)
		load tip
		eject tip
	
	Gripper:
		move (x, y, z, speed)
		open
		close
		rotate axis 1
		rotate axix 2
		
	Modules: ...

		
High level instruction (examples):
	# Complex actions composed of many low or high level instructions.
	
	load tip:
		move to (x, y)
		move down
		move up
	
	transfer (with tool "pipette" from labware "L1" to labware "L2"):
		load tip (see above)
		move to L1
		move to bottom of L1
		aspirate x ul
		move up
		move to L2
		move to bottom of L2
		dispense x+? ul
		move up
		go to waste
		move down
		eject tip

				
Protocol:
	# Sequence of many instructions (low or high level)
	# bound to a specific deck layout and tool rack layout.
	# possibility to loop a set of instructions.
